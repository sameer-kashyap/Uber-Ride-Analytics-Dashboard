# Uber Ride Analytics Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive analysis of Uber's ride-hailing operations, built from a detailed set of business requirements. The primary goal was to create a centralized, interactive Power BI dashboard to help stakeholders track KPIs and identify trends across bookings, revenue, riders, and vehicle performance.

The dashboard consolidates scattered data into a single source of truth, featuring dynamic page navigation, a collapsible filter panel, and detailed drill-downs.

## üöÄ Key Interactive Features

This report was designed to be highly interactive and user-friendly:

* **Multi-Page Analysis:** A responsive **visual slicer** is used to navigate between 5 distinct report pages, allowing for a seamless user experience that works well on different screen sizes.
* **Collapsible Filter Panel:** A "hide-and-show" bookmark button (on the top-right) maximizes report space while providing powerful filtering options (by Vehicle, Payment Method, etc.).
* **Drill-Downs & Cross-Filtering:** All visuals on each page are interconnected, allowing users to click on any data point (e.g., a vehicle type or a month) and see the entire report filter in real-time.
